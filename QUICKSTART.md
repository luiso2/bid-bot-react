# Quick Start - Fixing PostCSS Error

## The Issue
You're seeing this error because PostCSS is trying to load an ES module configuration file in a CommonJS context.

## Quick Fix

### Option 1: Run the fix script (Windows)
```bash
fix-postcss.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual fix
1. Delete or rename `postcss.config.js` if it exists
2. Make sure `postcss.config.cjs` exists with CommonJS syntax
3. Clear cache and reinstall:
   ```bash
   npm run clean
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

### Option 3: Clean install (Windows)
```bash
clean-install.bat
```

## After fixing, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app should now start on http://localhost:3000

## Still having issues?
1. Check Node.js version: `node -v` (should be 16+)
2. Try: `setup-legacy.bat` for compatibility mode
3. See TROUBLESHOOTING.md for more solutions
